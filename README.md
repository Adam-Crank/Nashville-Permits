# Nashville-Permits

## Overview
This dashboard, exported recently as a powerpoint, made use of a data set of building permit applications, both accepted and denied, sourced from the city of 
Nashville's open data database, and features a brief dashboard examining some of the features found within this data:

1. Number of permit applications by Greater Nashville area zipcode
2. The top five zip codes with the highest number of permit applications, decreasing from left to right, and a breakdown of what types of building permits are being
  applied for in these areas.
  - further exploration of this data is available in Tableau/the corresponding .twb file, but does not translate well to powerpoint format exported for use here.
3. The number of permits applied for by permit type
4. The cost of construction by permit type (which differs from point 2 since not all permit applications are accepted). Again, refer to the caveat above regarding 
  Tableau vs. Powerpoint view.
5. A scatter plot comparing the above two metrics with each other, to better visualize the disparity between how much money is spent per permit type and what permit 
  types are being applied for.
